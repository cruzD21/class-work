In this lab, you use what you have learned about searching an array to find an exact matc.
  The program uses an array that contains valid names for 10 cities in Michigan.
  Ask the user of the program to enter a city name; program then searches the array for that city name. If it is not found,
  the program should print a message that informs the user the city name is not found in the list of valid cities in Michigan. The data 
  file provided for this lab includes the input statements and the necessary variable declarations. You need to use a loop to examine all 
  the items in the array and test for a match. You also need to set a flag if there is a match, and then test the flag variable to determine 
  if you should print the "Not a city in Michigan" message.
